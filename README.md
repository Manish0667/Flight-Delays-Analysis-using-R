# ✈️ Flight Delays Analysis using R

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing flight delay patterns and understanding how factors like weather conditions, airline carriers, and departure schedules affect delays.

The analysis was performed using **R programming** with exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis on flight delay data  
- Identify trends and factors influencing delays  
- Visualize relationships using various plots  
- Support airport authorities in understanding delay causes  

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about flights including:

- `schedtime` – Scheduled departure time  
- `carrier` – Airline carrier code  
- `deptime` – Actual departure time  
- `origin` – Origin airport  
- `dest` – Destination airport  
- `weather` – Weather delay indicator  
- `dayweek` – Day of week  
- `daymonth` – Day of month  
- `delay` – Delay status (ontime/delayed)

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- R Programming  
- `readxl` – Reading Excel datasets  
- `ggplot2` – Data visualization  
- `dplyr` – Data manipulation  

---

## 📊 Key Visualizations
✔ Histograms (Scheduled time, carrier, origin, destination)  
✔ Scatter Plot (On-time vs delayed flights)  
✔ Box Plot (Delay variation across month days)  
✔ Pie Chart (Delayed vs On-time flights)

## ✅ Project Outcome
This project helped understand flight delay patterns and improved practical skills in:

- Data Cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis  
- Visualization in R  
- Reporting insights
